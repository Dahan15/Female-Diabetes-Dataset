# Female-Diabetes-Dataset

---

## 📄 Project Description  
The **Female Diabetes** project aims to build a predictive model to detect the likelihood of diabetes in women based on a set of health indicators.  
The project analyzes data including the number of pregnancies, glucose level, diastolic blood pressure, skinfold thickness, insulin levels, Body Mass Index (BMI), Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF), and age.  
The data is processed and analyzed to extract useful insights and build a classification model using machine learning techniques.
